# ðŸŒŒ Anime Galaxy

**Working Demo**: Check it out @ https://softuni-firebase-angular.web.app/

**Comment**: My first ever project built from scratch without a tutorial with Angular. I started this without much experience and knowledge in CSS, tailwind CSS or using pre-made components so that part is a bit of a mess and the website was unfortunately not made to be responsive. Although it can be fixed, it would take a longer time than I am willing to spare on the project. Design-wise for desktop I think it turned out not so bad. The next one should be better.
## ðŸŒ  Features:

- **Vast Anime Collection**: Seamlessly load and view a comprehensive database of available anime.
- **Color Scheme**: Uses preferred color scheme of Device.
- **Intuitive Pagination and Search**: Find and navigate to your preferred anime with ease.
- **User Authentication**: Securely sign up and log in with robust Firebase authentication.
- **Profile Editing**: Allows the following:
  - Modifying email, display name, and password.
  - Uploading a personal avatar or selecting from an exclusive gallery.
- **Anime Lists**:
  - Track anime you love with the *Liked List*.
  - Plan your next binge with the *Watchlist*.
- **Lazy loading**: Implemented to test out the effects of the feature.

## ðŸŽ¡ Backend Architecture - Firebase + Jikan API:

- **User Authentication**: Employs Firebase Authentication for a secure user experience.
- **Data Storage**: Leverages Firestore for storing user-related data:
  - **Main User Collection**: Contains documents uniquely identified by user IDs housing user data.
  - **Sub-collections**: Dedicated to the user's anime 'Liked' and 'Watchlist' with anime IDs as unique identifiers pointing to specific anime details.
- **Anime API**: Utilizes the Jikan API, an unofficial MAL API, to fetch extensive anime details.
- **Avatar Storage**: Firebase's Cloud Storage hosts user avatars with the naming convention: `userID|avatar`.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure:

- **Core Module**: Houses essential singleton services and components.
- **Shared Module**: Consists of common components, directives, and pipes that are used across the app.
- **User Module**: Focused on user-centric features like authentication, profile management, etc.
- **Anime Module**: Deals with all things anime, from listing to detailed views.
- **Environments**: Separate environments.
